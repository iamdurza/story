'''A bright flash of light and a sence of virtigo!


    You wake up felling dizzy on a old dirt road. You see hoof prints leading to a dark forest. As it gets close to the forest, the road 
    splits off, heading twords a village in the distance. There is smoke rising from one of the chimneys, so you know it is populated,
    but not neceseraly by humans.'''
